  let newsletterContent = `Welcome to this week's drop of **The Trade Winds**. Below is a snapshot of the yield data we currently have on deck, a curated sample of actionable opportunities, and a brief overview of what is influencing the market this week.

Market Influences
[Insert market influences here, e.g.:
* Renewed energy from Token2049 in Singapore & Solana Breakpoint
* Tailwinds from FED 0.5% rate cut and dovish FOMC.]

[Insert market sentiment analysis here, e.g.:
Token2049 showed that despite recent general apathy across the market in primarily anything beyond BTC, there is undoubtedly a significant drive to progress the industry forward, with a larger community of builders and advocates every year. Raises for new projects are still in full swing, with an expected wave of existing projects preparing to deploy their highly anticipated tokens in Q4 this year (e.g. EigenLayer & Hyperliquid).

The FED cutting interest rates by 0.5%, communicating things are on track whilst pointing at a soft landing, and the BOJ keeping rates steady have given the markets the beginnings of a beneficial tailwind that could snowball, providing recession fears stay muted. Over six trillion dollars in money market funds are taking advantage of the current high interest rate environment, and everyone is betting on a portion of that to migrate into risk assets over the next few years.]

    riskDistribution.Medium || 0
  }) falling into the medium-risk category, ${riskDistribution.Low || 0} low-risk options, and ${
    riskDistribution.High || 0
  } high-risk options. Below are the yield highlights for both the Stablecoin and ETH categories.

Stablecoin Yield:
${formatNumericDistribution(stablecoinYieldDistribution)}

ETH Yield:

Weekly DeFi Concept
[Insert weekly DeFi concept here, e.g.:
Yield Farming
Yield farming involves lending or staking cryptocurrency assets to generate returns. Users provide liquidity to DeFi protocols and earn rewards, often through the platform's native tokens. 
**Example:** A user deposits USDC into a lending protocol like Aave. They earn interest on their USDC and receive additional AAVE tokens as an incentive, potentially increasing their overall yield.]
